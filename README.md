Tracker, inventory tracking application
The Tracker: Inventory Management App helps warehouses by tracking inventory and sending real-time updates and notifications. 
It's made for managers, staff, and coordinators, providing accurate reports and easy ways to update quantities. The app includes secure login, an inventory display, item management, and notifications. 
We used simple coding methods, frequent testing, and user-friendly design to make sure it works well. We solved challenges with real-time notifications to keep the experience smooth. 
Testing showed the need for good input validation and permission handling. This project taught effective techniques for future app development, especially in secure logins and real-time updates.
